# Changelog

All notable changes to GAPI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Discord Rich Presence** (`discord_presence.py`)
  - New `DiscordPresence` class wraps `pypresence` with a thread-safe, non-blocking
    design; all IPC work happens in daemon threads so Flask request handlers are never
    blocked
  - Opt-in: set `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` in `.env` to your Discord application's numeric
    Client ID (create one free at https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  - Graceful degradation: if `pypresence` is not installed, or if Discord is not
    running on the host, GAPI logs a debug message and continues normally without
    raising an exception
  - The game name, playtime, and a "GAPI picked this game" state line are shown in the
    Rich Presence panel; details and state lines are fully customisable
  - `DiscordPresence.update(game_name, playtime_hours, details)` — called automatically
    inside `POST /api/pick` when a game is successfully picked
  - `DiscordPresence.clear()` — called automatically on `POST /api/auth/logout`
  - `DiscordPresence.close()` — for clean shutdown
  - 16 new unit tests covering disabled mode, missing-pypresence, connect/update/clear,
    connection failures, thread safety, environment-variable configuration
  - `pypresence>=4.3.0` added to `requirements.txt` as an optional dependency
  - `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` documented in `.env.example`

- **Localization / i18n** (`locales/` directory + two REST endpoints)
  - `locales/en.json` — full English translation strings for all UI sections:
    `nav`, `pick`, `library`, `reviews`, `tags`, `backlog`, `playlists`,
    `schedule`, `budget`, `wishlist`, `voting`, `stats`, `auth`, `common`
  - `locales/es.json` — complete Spanish (Español) translation with the same
    structure; all section keys and sub-keys are present
  - `GET /api/i18n` — lists all available locales (returns `lang` + `lang_name`)
  - `GET /api/i18n/<lang>` — returns the full translation object for a language;
    `404` when the requested language is not available; path-traversal is sanitised
    (directory separators and `..` components are stripped before file lookup)
  - 13 new tests covering the list/get endpoints, structural parity between locales,
    404 handling, and path-traversal safety

- **CI: expanded coverage scope**
  - `--cov` flags now include `discord_presence`, `openapi_spec`, and `app/`
  - `discord_presence.py` and `openapi_spec.py` added to the syntax-check step

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Complete service migration** — all remaining Flask route handlers now use services
  directly instead of calling `GamePicker` domain methods:
  - Reviews (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/reviews`, `/api/reviews/<game_id>`) →
    `picker.review_service`
  - Tags (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/tags`, `/api/library/by-tag/<tag>`) →
    `picker.tag_service`
  - Schedule (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/schedule`) → `picker.schedule_service`
  - Playlists (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/playlists`, `/api/playlists/<name>/games`) →
    `picker.playlist_service`
  - Backlog (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/backlog`) → `picker.backlog_service`
  - Pick route tag-filter and game-details enrichment → `picker.tag_service`,
    `picker.review_service`, `picker.backlog_service`
  - Export routes (`/api/export/library`, `/api/export/favorites`) →
    `picker.review_service`, `picker.tag_service`, `picker.backlog_service`,
    `picker.favorites_service`

### Added
- **`GET /api/openapi.json`** — serves the full OpenAPI 3.0 specification (JSON)
  generated by `openapi_spec.build_spec()`; server URL is set dynamically from the
  request's base URL
- **`GET /api/docs`** — Swagger UI (via CDN) for interactive API exploration

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Service/Repository architecture** — separates business logic from the Flask UI layer
  - `app/repositories/` package: `BaseRepository` (atomic JSON write/read) + nine concrete
    repository classes: `ReviewRepository`, `TagRepository`, `ScheduleRepository`,
    `PlaylistRepository`, `BacklogRepository`, `BudgetRepository`, `WishlistRepository`,
    `FavoritesRepository`, `HistoryRepository`
  - `app/services/` package: eight service classes containing all domain/business logic:
    `ReviewService`, `TagService`, `ScheduleService`, `PlaylistService`, `BacklogService`,
    `BudgetService`, `WishlistService`, `FavoritesService`
  - `GamePicker.__init__` wires repositories and services; exposes them as
    `picker.review_service`, `picker.budget_service`, `picker.wishlist_service`, etc.
  - Legacy `picker.xxx` dict/list attributes now point at the same in-memory object as
    the corresponding repository — full backward compatibility, zero test regressions
  - Budget API endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/budget`) refactored to use
    `picker.budget_service` directly, demonstrating the pattern
  - Wishlist API endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/wishlist`, `GET /api/wishlist/sales`)
    refactored to use `picker.wishlist_service` directly
  - 104 new unit/integration tests in `tests/test_services.py` covering all repos and
    services (total test count: 265, up from 161)
- **Dependabot** — `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates (pip + actions)
- **Code coverage configuration** — `setup.cfg` with `[coverage:run]` / `[coverage:report]`
  sections; CI now produces `coverage.xml` and uploads it as a build artefact
- **Type checking (mypy)** — `mypy.ini` settings in `setup.cfg`; new `typecheck` job in CI
- **OpenAPI 3.0 documentation** — `openapi_spec.py` builds a full spec dict for all 83
  API endpoints; serves at `GET /api/openapi.json` and `GET /api/docs` (Swagger UI via CDN)

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

  - New `GamePicker` methods: `load_wishlist()`, `save_wishlist()`, `add_to_wishlist()`,
    `remove_from_wishlist()`, `check_wishlist_sales()`
  - Per-game entries: `game_id`, `name`, `platform`, `added_date`, `target_price`, `notes`
  - `check_wishlist_sales()` calls the Steam Store API for live prices; returns games
    that are discounted **or** at/below the user's target price
  - New `SteamAPIClient.get_price_overview(app_id)` — lightweight price-only Steam call
    (does not pollute the full details cache)

  - `GET /api/wishlist` — list all wishlist entries (login required)
  - `POST /api/wishlist` — add/update a wishlist entry (login required)
  - `DELETE /api/wishlist/<game_id>` — remove a wishlist entry (login required)
  - `GET /api/wishlist/sales` — live sale check for all Steam wishlist items (login required)
  - 21 new unit tests covering all wishlist and price-overview code paths
- **CI/CD Pipeline** — new `.github/workflows/tests.yml` GitHub Actions workflow
  - Runs on every push to `main` / `copilot/**` branches and on all pull requests
  - Python 3.11, installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
  - Executes full pytest suite with coverage report (`--cov=gapi --cov=multiuser`)
  - Verifies syntax of all main Python modules

  - `POST /api/voting/create` accepts `voting_method` in request body
  - `POST /api/voting/<id>/vote` accepts `ranking` (list) for ranked-choice sessions

  - Per-game entries: `price`, `currency`, `purchase_date`, `notes`
  - Aggregated summary: `total_spent`, `primary_currency`, `currency_breakdown`,
    `game_count`, `entries` (sorted by purchase date, enriched with game names)
  - Persisted to `.gapi_budget.json` via atomic write
  - `GET /api/budget` — retrieve all entries + summary (login required)
  - `POST/PUT /api/budget/<game_id>` — set / update budget entry (login required)
  - `DELETE /api/budget/<game_id>` — remove budget entry (login required)

- Steam API client now respects configurable timeout value
- Enhanced error messages with actionable suggestions

### Security
