# GAPI Desktop App

An **Electron** desktop application for macOS, Windows, and Linux that puts
GAPI in your system tray.  Pick a random game, browse your library, and get
a desktop notification — all without opening a browser tab.

## Features

- **🎮 Quick Pick** — three pick modes: Random / Unplayed / Barely Played
- **📚 Library Browser** — full game list with search and platform filter
- **🕒 Pick History** — recent picks with relative timestamps
- **⚙ Settings** — configurable GAPI server URL (persisted across restarts)
- **System Tray**
  - Tray icon with connection indicator badge
  - Context menu: Pick a Game / Open Window / Open in Browser / Settings / Quit
  - Desktop `Notification` when a game is picked (from tray or in-app)
- **Periodic health check** — tray badge turns red when server is unreachable
- **🎮 Gamepad / Controller support** — full Gamepad API integration (see below)
- **macOS** — native hidden inset title bar, stays in tray when window is closed
- **Windows / Linux** — standard windowed app, minimise to tray on close

## Requirements

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|

## Quick Start

cd desktop-app
npm install

## Configuration

Set your GAPI server URL in the **Settings** panel.  The app persists it via
`electron-store` (stored in the OS user data directory).

Default: `http://localhost:5000`

## Building Distributables

```bash
# macOS (DMG)
npm run dist:mac

# Windows (NSIS installer)
npm run dist:win

# Linux (AppImage + .deb)
npm run dist:linux

# All platforms (requires appropriate build tools)
npm run dist
```

Built files appear in `desktop-app/dist/`.

### Publishing to the web UI

The web app exposes a **Downloads** page that serves desktop installers
directly. To make a build downloadable there, copy the installer artifacts into
the server's downloads directory:

```bash
# Default location: <repo>/downloads
cp dist/*.{exe,dmg,AppImage,deb} ../downloads/
```

Override the directory with the `GAPI_DOWNLOADS_DIR` environment variable. The
server auto-detects `.exe`/`.msi` (Windows), `.dmg`/`.pkg` (macOS), and
`.AppImage`/`.deb`/`.rpm`/`.snap` (Linux) files and lists them grouped by
platform. The browser extension is zipped and served automatically — no build
step needed.

> Tip: set **Public Server URL** under *Admin → General Settings* so the
> downloaded extension (and its in-app instructions) point at your real server
> instead of `localhost`.

## System Tray

The tray icon appears in the system tray / menu bar as soon as the app starts.

| Tray menu item | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| 🎮 Pick a Game | Picks a random game and shows a desktop notification |
| 🪟 Open GAPI Window | Brings the main window to the front |
| ↗ Open in Browser | Opens the GAPI server URL in your default browser |
| 🟢/🔴 Connected/Disconnected | Status indicator (not clickable) |
| ⚙ Settings | Opens the Settings panel |
| Quit GAPI | Quits the application |

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## IPC API Reference

The renderer communicates with the main process through `window.gapiAPI`:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `getServerUrl()` | Get current server URL |
| `setServerUrl(url)` | Save new server URL |
| `getConnectionStatus()` | Current connection status |
| `quickPick(mode)` | Pick a random game |

| `onOpenSettings(cb)` | Listen for settings open request |


## Gamepad / Controller Support

GAPI Desktop supports **any standard gamepad** via the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API).
Just connect a controller (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro, etc.) and a HUD overlay
will confirm it is detected.
